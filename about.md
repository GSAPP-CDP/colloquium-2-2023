## About the Program

Computation Design Practices is an innovative program for recent graduates and practitioners that extends and integrates
disciplines between architecture, data visualization, and urban planningâ€”focusing specifically on computational design
practices for the built environment at multiple scales. It aims to pioneer new concepts and pedagogies for an integrated
multi-scalar and spatial approach to computational design at [Columbia GSAPP](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/). The M.S.CDP curriculum encourages critical and
creative engagement with spatial computational design as both method and practice.

An archive of student final projects from the program is
