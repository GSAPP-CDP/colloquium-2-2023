        Engagement with Computation: Detecting how social media uses its influence to act back to the physical world. Use a traditional way of manually collecting data. Bias might be shown in how algorithms affect what we see differently. I will try to do interviews with other students from other departments to collect some search data and like data from their social media. To approach this topic, the project aims to land on “narrative avatar,” “ambient interfaces,” or "responsive systems" that respond to the conditions of the human body, data networks, and the environment. The interactive installation using sensor-motion detectors perfectly blends physical space and computational logic. At its core, this project will collect real-time data from motion sensors. The system will need to differentiate between various types of motion, perhaps categorizing them based on speed, direction, or pattern. This data will then be used to trigger specific responses in the installation, whether it's a visual display, sound, or any other form of feedback. The complexity of the computational process can be scaled based on the desired interaction level, from simple motion detection to more intricate patterns or sequences.

             Game scenario game development - designed space

      Engagement with Computation:
Game development is inherently computational. The designed space within the game scenario will require a combination of algorithms, physics engines, and AI to create a responsive environment. This environment will not only react to player actions but can also evolve based on certain in-game events or player decisions. The game's logic will be built on conditional statements, ensuring that each player's experience is unique based on their interactions with the designed space. Additionally, the use of procedural generation can be explored to create dynamic spaces within the game, further emphasizing the role of computation in shaping the gaming experience.

        <h1> 3. Cyberic Video - future human and digital interface interation </h1>
            <h2>
            topic: Future city and potational tangible interaction	data: try find current smart city datasets
            </h2>
            <p>
            Engagement with Computation:
A Cyberic Video, which refers to a video that integrates elements of cybernetics and digital augmentation, is deeply rooted in computation. The creation of such a video would involve digital simulations, visual effects, and possibly even AI-driven content. The video can be enhanced using computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create scenes or elements that blend the boundaries between reality and digital augmentation. Furthermore, if the video is interactive, it would require computational logic to respond to user inputs, changing the narrative or visual elements in real-time. The process of editing, rendering, and integrating digital elements into the video is a testament to the power of modern computational techniques.
