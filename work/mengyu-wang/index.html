            <h1> 1. Decolonizing Museums </h1>
            <h2>
             Computational methods: data analysis, data visualization, AR/VR
            </h2>
            <p>
             Within a museum curated by Western colonizers, the untold stories of adversity and hardship endured by these exquisite artworks before their arrival remain obscured and largely unacknowledged. My project of Decolonizing Museums will engage with computation by employing data analysis and visualization to confront the prevailing narratives within museums with a colonial history. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My project aims to deconstruct and reshape the concealed injustices inherent in these museums, addressing the neglect of non-Western cultures, complicity in illicit acquisitions of cultural artifacts, and the celebration of colonizers. Utilizing museum catalogs as my database, I will scrutinize these items' origins, cultural background, periods, and acquisition methods, effectively revealing the museum's colonial history through data visualization. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ultimately, my objective is to create a decolonized virtual museum, presented in virtual spaces, to offer entirely fresh narratives for the same artworks in the same places, thereby contributing to the broader goal of decolonization. Through the fusion of computational techniques and critical analysis, my project challenges established narratives and promotes a more inclusive and equitable representation of cultural heritage.

            <h1> 2. Reversed Female Narratives </h1>
            <h2>
             Computational methods: data analysis, machine learning, object recognition, unsupervised, installation
            </h2>
            <p>
            This question drove me to reflect on women's identity in museum narratives and challenge the male domination that women are often relegated to the object of the male gaze rather than active subjects. My idea engages with computation by using the open-source image dataset in museums and leveraging data analysis and machine-learning techniques to address critical questions about the representation of women in art history. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Through tagging the image and training a machine learning model, I aim to pinpoint the presence of female figures within artworks, uncovering their postures, degrees of nudity, facial expressions, ethnicity, age, motherhood, etc. This computational approach will deconstruct the historical portrayal of women through the male lens and shed light on those female images marginalized by mainstream narratives. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ultimately, I aspire to capture those images that deviate from conventional depictions of women, using unsupervised machine learning or other digital technologies to construct a female installation that defies mainstream male aesthetics. By combining computational analysis with artistic critique, this project challenges existing norms and offers a fresh perspective on the role of women in art, prompting a much-needed reevaluation of their representation in cultural institutions.

            <h1> 3. Psychology of Crowds in Museums </h1>
            <h2>
             Computational methods: data analysis, sensors, AR/VR
            </h2>
            <p>
             My idea begins by observing the phenomenon where the modest-sized Mona Lisa always draws massive crowds, while nearby, a grand Titian masterpiece often goes unnoticed. Determining which artwork is objectively superior is a challenging task, yet the allocation of exhibition space is overwhelmingly disproportionate. Obviously, the area the artworks receive is not solely based on their physical dimensions. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In the digital realm, an artwork's fame, online visibility, and auction house prices all influence its exhibition prominence. In the physical world, the more people gather in front of a piece, the more it attracts additional viewers. More miniature artworks occupying larger spaces also gain more attention. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Both in the virtual and real world, the popularity of the artworks influences human behavior through the psychology of conformity. Can we quantify the impact of this conformity on people's exhibition experiences through computation and visualize it to help individuals appreciate art with a purer perspective? 
            </p>
            <p>
            I aim to design an installation that provides real-time displays of an artwork's online exposure while simultaneously measuring foot traffic and dwell times in front of the artwork using sensors. This installation, integrated into the exhibition, will either challenge or exacerbate the psychology of conformity in audiences' exhibition behaviorâ€”a question that piques my curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
            Subsequently, could we employ this data to redistribute space and craft a virtual exhibition area that is more equitably structured? By incorporating the artwork dimensions and their inflated levels of attention into Grasshopper, we can generate a more impartial environment for contemplating art, offering a frame of reference for self-reflection on our psychology of conformity.
