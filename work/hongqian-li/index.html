    <h1>3 Ideas for Capstone</h1>
    <h2>Proposal I: City GAN–using computer vision to capture the locality of different cityscapes and reshape ways of experiencing cities. </h2>
    <p>
        The exploration of cities, their neighborhoods, zones, dynamics, and interrelationships, has been a longstanding focus in the fields of architecture, urban studies, and urban planning. Jane Jacobs and other urban thinkers developed different ways of looking at the city. With the advent of big data and advancements in computer vision technology, transformative ways of understanding are emerging that could potentially redefine our understanding of cities and alter our perspectives on urban environments. As computation allows data-driven, multi-layer, real-time practices, compared with traditional ways, there may be some interesting findings… 
        <br>In this study, I first plan to examine 3 different popular computer vision Generative adversarial networks (or GAN), DCGAN, StyleGAN, and Pix2Pix, and their capacities to CAPTURE cities’ characteristics. Since the way GANs work is to keep comparing the generative images with real ones until they pass the testing of the discriminator, the generative images will reveal certain properties useful in uncovering the nature of urban places, such as forms, textures, colors, and qualities of light. 
        <br>Secondly, after the capture of the cities’ properties, I plan to explore GANs’ abilities of style transformation, which would be interesting to test and “play with” and RESHAPE our understanding of the cities. For example, it can generate an image of a city that has characteristics of different cities. Maybe there would be some interesting topics to explore…
        Some ideas/topics:
        (1) urban inequity: comparing affluent and underprivileged cities to scrutinize the disparities in their cityscapes…
        (2) health problem: taking images of a part of a city that has lower health cases and a part of a city that has higher. Take an unhealthy city image and generate what it would be like if it were healthier…as a way to understand if the cityscape has an impact on public health…

    <h2>Proposal II: GAN Explainer- building an explanatory website for GAN</h2>
    <p>
        Generative adversarial networks (or GAN) are used widely in generative art and urban study…from the “Unsupervised” at MOMA (using CDGAN, PGAN, and StyleGAN) to architecture firms using pix2pix to expedite and streamline the simulation(sun exposure, wind speed…).
        <br>However, its inherent obscurity renders it a 'black box’. Many people don't understand it, yet it influences our lives increasingly. It is important to enhance transparency, accountability, and fairness in machine learning models to foster widespread positive societal impacts. 
        <br>In this study, I plan to make an explanatory website for this technology and publish it, to explain it to the public and improve its transparency. I plan to first dive into the history of this GAN algorithm and develop a whole understanding of its functionality, application, and potential bias… For now, some initial ideas
        (1)storytelling of the history of the GAN algorithm and its applications or potential future use(in urban study and beyond). 
        (2)visualization of the process of how an image got generative.
        (3)interactive visualization to show what it is good at/ bad at…

    <h2>Proposal III: Real-time City</h2>
    <p>
        The concept of "Real-time City" traditionally denotes a methodology where municipal governments employ real-time analytics to monitor and manage diverse facets of urban operations and functionalities. This approach is evident in various domains of urban life, from the proprietary predictive policing algorithms of the New York Police Department to Uber's demand forecasting and surge pricing algorithms, all of which are under the influence of digital anticipation. The proliferation of simulations has also given rise to ethical considerations. When the decisions and actions of real humans are represented through virtual simulations, how do we contemplate their rights? How can we advocate more effectively for the public, whose gestures, behaviors, and movement patterns have been documented, quantified, and integrated into digital trajectories to fuel insights that are subsequently inscribed back onto their bodies?
        <br>In this research, I intend to explore the inclination to synchronize everything in real-time and illustrate it, delving into its military roots. Initially, I aim to scrutinize the widely used real urban simulations and their data acquisition practices, mapping systems, and synthetic human decision-making models to identify potential points of intervention. Furthermore, I aspire to utilize real-time rendering technology as a counter model to reimagine and conceptualize different possibilities that these military-oriented desires for command and control seem to present.
