              Delve is an innovative tool that leverages machine learning and generative design to optimize urban development projects. 
              It assists in creating designs that maximize overall value while considering various constraints and requirements.

            <p>
              There are some open-source repos available on GitHub that employ machine learning algorithms for predicting building energy 
              consumption. These projects utilize historical energy use data, environmental conditions to train and 
              validate their predictive models, offering a base for understanding and forecasting energy demands in different types of buildings.

            <h2>Data for exploration</h2>
            <p>
              Need access to datasets containing building parameters and constraints, environmental conditions, user behavior, and energy consumption. 
              This data need to be found on publicly available datasets.

            </p>
            <h2>Project Scales</h2>
            <p>
              The project operates on multiple scales, from individual buildings to urban blocks.

              MIT media lab: The Deep Image of the City: the project utilizes GANs to create deep images of cities, 
              which are essentially synthesized representations of urban areas that don't necessarily exist in reality but are plausible 
              based on the learned patterns and features from real urban imagery. 
            </p>

            <h2>Data for Exploration</h2>

            <h2>Project Scales</h2>
            <p>
              While initial tests may focus on specific districts or areas within cities, the methodology can be also applied to villages(for example, traditional villages in China)

              Autodesk Project Dasher employs environmental sensors to gather continuous data on various parameters like 
              temperature, humidity, occupancy, and energy consumption. This sensor-derived data is then dynamically mapped onto the building's 3D 
              BIM model. Through this integration, Project Dasher provides a comprehensive, real-time overview of the building's performance and 
              environmental conditions, enabling architects, engineers, and facility managers to understand and optimize the operation of buildings 
              effectively.
