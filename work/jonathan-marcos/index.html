                    <h3><b>In simpler terms, <i>What is a food desert?</i></b></h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Initial Hypothesis: Food deserts are areas that have increased difficulty in accessing affordable healthier food options. This is mainly due to certain parameters, such as income, lower density of supermarkets, etc.</p>
                    <p>The following parameters all work together in order to tell a clearer image of which neighborhoods would most likely be food deserts. The following correlation graphs and choropleths were experiments into fusing these datasets together to test points to justify the initial hypothesis</p>
                <br>
                    <p><b>FOUND DATASETS:</b></p>
                    <p>- Census (Income, Population, Food Stamp Counts, Poverty Status)</p>
                    <p>- Restaurants (via Restaurant Inspection Results for now, may use Google Places API to expand the scope of the dataset)</p>
                    <p>- Vacant lots (future: for solution speculation)</p>
                    <p>- Supermarkets (filtering NYS food vendor data to NYC bounds and filtering to >10k square foot stores in accordance to FRESH requirements)</p>
                
                    <p><b>DATA TO BE FOUND:</b></p>
                    <p>- Health data (Chronic Health Condition prevalence, findable from PrattCenter (if website goes back up))</p>
                    <p>- Cutoff to comfortably afford three meals</p>
                    <p>- Restaurant prices over time</p>

                    <p>Food deserts are areas that have higher prevalence of health issues and increased difficulty in accessing healthier food options. This is mainly due to certain parameters, such as income, lower density of supermarkets, etc.</p>

                <h1><b>How can interventions be made for food deserts?</b></h1>

                <br>
                <p>These particular solutions would be temporary, as the economic and culinary landscape of NYC is in constant change. For instance, some neighborhoods would probably benefit from food desert intervention in some years, but when the situation wanes in that neighborhood and other neighborhoods need interventions more, then this infrastructure would move.</p>
                <p>These speculations are mostly looking into the use of temporary spaces, such as vacant lots, or vacant storefronts</p>
                <br>
                <p>This custom tool will most likely be an interactive map-app, showing 1. the map, 2. associated graphs and 3. customizable parameters for the simulation</p>
                <p>This tool would primarily be for the government of NYC to identify optimal places for food desert information, but can also be used by restaurants and food-vending services for optimal placement</p>
                <p>The scope of this project is to be a Public Interest Technology-- tech that works for the good of the public by informing them of the food desert situation in NYC</p>
