                <h3><b>i. Optimizing NYC Libaries' Public Services for Vulnerable Populations</b></h3>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="214111_000_N70_large-scaled.jpg">
                    <h6>Above: Millstein Center Library, Barnard College</h6>
                </div>
                <p>When it comes to immigrating from one country to another, there are bound to be social and cultural adjustments that can make it uneasy for those to adapt to their new homes. For example, In Garnette Cadogan's <i>Walking While Black</i>, moving from Kingston, to NO, to NYC had different social implications that incurred a degree of alienation and discrimination. Libraries are hubs of data, curating important information such as books, passports, legal documents and municipal events. However, some immigrants may have difficulties with accessing these resources due to potential language and social barriers, creating environments of isolation and disengagement within the communities around them.</p>
                <p>Recently, however, with the recent events of the pandemic and the emergence of e-books and databases, these back end functions have risen more into prominence in NYC's libraries, placing workload pressure that these libraries couldn't precedent.</p>
                <h5>- How do we create a library network that allows for the optimization of libraries based on different language and ethnic backgrounds? </h5>
                <h5>- How do we create a library network that engages a safe space for immigrants to learn?</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>Compared to these precedents, this proposal is going to combine multiple datasets in order to optimize different forms of intervention (i.e. libraries that could cater more towards French speakers, libraries that host more senior citizen events, etc.). The combination of this data will allow for the maps to act as a tool to determine these intervention points.</p>
                <p>Besides the human and the computer, the spaces within and around these libraries would be affected as well. Libraries may have to curate themselves in order to adapt more to certain events (i.e. space for square dancing, tables for local chess clubs, etc.) and the specialization of libraries for the populations around them will affect the overall psyche and environment of the infrastructure (i.e. going to a library suited more for senior citizen events compared to a library suited more for learning English)</p>
                <p>Of course, areas that may not be as close to a library (or have libraries in under-funded neighborhoods) may not receive as much benefits from these library interventions. However, this brings up opportunities for library network expansion in these under-exposed areas.</p>
                <p>This project will explore this expanded library network on multiple scales-- from the City as a whole to particular neighborhoods, to show different degrees of cultural impact.</p>

                <h3><b>ii. Mapping NYC's Housing Domino Effect and How It Affects Vulnerable Populations</b></h3>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="ogimage.png">
                    <h6>Above: Redlining of Harlem & South Bronx Over Mapbox Underlay. Historially, redlined communities have been where minorities were relegated to due to generally lower quality of life. However, these spaces have now become primary targets for gentrified housing</h6>
                </div>
                <p>There is an ongoing ripple effect going on in NYC's housing market- because of rising housing prices and local housing development, NYC residents are finding themselves relocating to different boroughs in search for more affordable rent. However, this causes a ripple effect- those living in these adjacent boroughs have to deal with increased housing costs as a consequence, also pressuring locals to either relocate or pay the increased rent. </p>
                <h5>- How do we map the housing market increases over time in order to storytell the ongoing domino effect in housing?</h5>
                <h5>- How do we use this storytelling to discuss the disproportionate consequences it has amongst minorities?</h5>
                <h5>- How can we use these maps in order to predict housing trends within the near future in order to inform gentrification trends?</h5>
                <h5>- How can we use the storytelling of this data to inform the need for interrogations in the housing market?</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>This expands on current gentrification projects by analyzing how these trends impact economically vulnerable areas, especially those that were once pointed out by redlining. These analyses will also model out where gentrification may occur next, alerting authorities of essential areas of financial interrogation.</p>
                <p>Besides the human and the computer, there's the cultural roots in neighborhoods that are vulnerable to being displaced due to gentrification. Though gentrification improves the overall conditions of the areas affected, minorities are most likely to get displaced and the diversity of culture weakens (i.e. Williamsburg, Lower East Side, etc.). The Architectural space would also begin to change as gentrification expands- the Architectural identity of these past neighborhoods would slowly be put to the side in favor of contrasting, higher-income infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Audiences that would most likely benefit from this proposal would be those trying to move into different areas of the city, realtors and municipal services. All of these groups can use these trends in order to determine where it would be best to move in, where it would be best to place anti-inflation measures, etc.</p>
                <p>This project will explore the housing domino effect on multiple scales-- from the City as a whole to particular neighborhoods, to show different degrees of financial and cultural impact.</p>

                    <h6>Above: Vendor serving customers at Queens Night Market.</h6>
                    <p>NYC is known to be a capital of food where many cultures come together to give NYC an identity for its culinary variety. However, some of this food tends to be expensive and rather unaffordable, and cheaper alternatives are more likely to be unhealthy. Food deserts in NYC are essentially areas where there aren't as many food options and hard to access healthy options without shelling out your wallet. </p>
                    <h6>- How can these food deserts be geographically visualized in order to determine optimal areas of intervention (and possibly suggested different kinds of intervention, i.e. more affordable food, more diverse cuisines)</h6>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The discussion of food deserts within the use of geographical visualization will tell a story on how certain areas throughout the City may not have as much accessibility to affordable and healthier options. These maps will ultimately create a suggestion model on where food interventions would be best to rejuvenate the culinary culture in these areas.</p>
                    <p>Though this would most likely inform optimal interventions for lower-income neighborhoods, areas that are already saturated with expensive options may not get as much priority in an intervention compared to areas with little options to choose from (i.e. East New York would more likely get an intervention compared to Midtown East)</p>
                    <p>The project will investigate multiple scales, first going into the city-scale of NYC and then into the neighborhood scale to optimize where food desert interventions would be best. </p>
