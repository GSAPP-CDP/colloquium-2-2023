                    <h3><b>Proposal I: Easing Library Workloads and Access Throughout NYC</b></h3>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Libraries are more than just circulators of books- rather, they create concrete foundations for other services, such as passports, printing, taxes and community services. However, ever since the beginning of the age of the e-book, libraries have had these latter services heightened in usage, resulting in a degree of work overload from these libraries. On top of that, some populations throughout NYC may not be able to access these resources as easily due to certain factors such as language barriers and proximity. How do we use computation in order to figure out certain aiding factors (i.e. languages throughout NYC, income, proximity to libraries, library traffic, etc.) and from there, create expanded networks that ease the pressure of library traffic in the city?</p>
                
                    <h3><b><i>(OPTIONAL AND SPECULATIVE) Proposal I expanded: Preserving Language Diversity in NYC</i></b></h3>
                    <p>Currently, the world speaks over 7000 languages- but many of those languages are in danger of becoming extinct due to mainstream languages being used more frequently in order to have a more universal connection to the world. However, languages are not just a spoken system; to a degree, they're also a genealogy of legacies from diverse cultures. In ethnically diverse cities, such as NYC, many immigrants came over for better opportunities. However, as generations pass, these unique cultures associated with immigrants are in greater danger of fading out, as generations become more assimilated and folded into American lifestyles. How do we create pseudo-sentient tools that could preserve various languages and cultural legacies to be accessed for generations to come? Furthermore, how do we create a space that allows for these tools to be accessible?</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Many incumbent navigation tools utilize many factors in order to give the best result to users, such as real-time traffic, accident advisories, speed limits, etc. However, many navigation tools struggle to implement real-time weather in its algorithms. Weather plays a significant role in transportation- abrasive weather conditions can really reduce the comfort of the driver, make driving conditions worse and can alter the time it takes from going from Point A to Point B. How can we create traffic tools that account for real-time weather and give optimized results for users? In the urban scale, how can we use weather as another parameter in order to choose the best transportation method between walking, cycling, driving and the subway?</p>

                    <h3><b>Proposal III: Revamping NYC's Funerary Infrastructure</b></h3>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>As the world becomes more populous, the demand for burial plots in NYC will stay constant, but the supply for burial spaces will decrease over time. Eventually, burial plots will be very scarce and alternative funerary traditions may need to occur in order to prevent cemetery overcrowding. Cemeteries and funerary homes could potentially create a network that allows for the management of funerary space and optimize remaining spaces within these cemeteries. With computation, there is the possibility of making spatial tools that optimize the amount of space available left in cemeteries in order to respectfully put the most amount of individuals in, but this is only for the short-term as space will inevitably run out.</p>
                
                    <h3><b><i>SPECULATIVE LONG TERM, NOT HASHED OUT YET: </i></b></h3>
                    <p>When the space does run out, how do we use computation to create a memorial network for the deceased throughout the city to be accessible to locals? Is there a way we can organize a schedule so audiences can see particular people at certain points of the day in order to prevent an excessive amount of space to be taken up by the deceased? How do we create networks that optimize this traffic of this new memorial infrastructure? </p>

                <b>What is the current condition:</b>
                <p></p>
                <p>When it comes to immigrating from one country to another, there are bound to be social and cultural adjustments that can make it uneasy for those to adapt to their new homes. For example, In Garnette Cadogan's Walking While Black, moving from Kingston, to NO, to NYC had different social implications that incurred a degree of alienation and discrimination. Libraries are hubs of data, curating important information such as books, passports, legal documents and municipal events. However, some immigrants may have difficulties with accessing these resources due to potential language and social barriers. </p>
                <p></p>
                <b>What is the desired change and why:</b>
                <p></p>
                <p>How do we create a library network that allows for the optimization of libraries based on different language and ethnic backgrounds? </p>

                <p>New York already hosts various events around the city that celebrate various cultures, such as DragonFest, Queens' Night Market, etc.</p>
                <p>Libraries already act as a hub for local gathering, i.e. local chess tournaments, culture nights, etc.</p>
