    <h2>Location Intelligence Otherwise</h2>
    <p>How did contemporary location intelligence platforms come to determine how we understand, interact with, and mediate space? And what is the extent of their impact on landscapes (the collapse of social, physical, digital around space? This project will explore the histories and trajectories of location intelligence, rooted in a history of spatial data science and cartography, towards finding points to intervene and imagine location intelligence (and its attendant systems) otherwise. I will then look to develop an alternative location intelligence platform, which is to say that I will make datasets (e.g. points of interest), a library of methods for analyzing and representing them, a mapping system to display and interact with them, and an API to allow other programs to interact and appropriate them.</p>

    <h2>Department of Slivers</h2>
    <p>This project takes Gordon Matta-Clark’s Fake Estates as a starting point for the development of a suite of practices for identifying, representing, and activating space and time against the grain, tactically retooling property relations and highlighting where they break down or fail across scales. I am interested in how computational techniques could assist in reclaiming and reconceptualizing property and ownership through the cracks and openings created by the tools and techniques that currently administer them. When and where is property exactly? And how is the public positioned in relation to it and its values? This project is partially a counter cartography of property regimes that brings prop-tech tropes to bear towards balancing the scales that have historically constructed property and its related dispossessions, consolidations. How can computation help extend the interstitial and allow for other ways of relating to property? </p>

    <h2>Atlas of Mapping Problems</h2>
    <p>Questions in critical web cartography will drive this project, which seeks to unpack the themes or fixations of maps (risk, time, scale, narrative, certainty, authority) , their defaults and their technology stacks by pushing towards new forms of data creation, information display, interaction, and storage for each. I’ll outline a set of core questions or problems, and take up a site, or scale, or dataset that represents challenges associated with mapping each theme otherwise, and build on top of existing web mapping frameworks to do so. A question I’d ask and develop mapping techniques around could be: how do you redact a map? Which would require an exploration of the interconnected systems and surfaces of map-based representation. Each question would result in an atlas section (or plate) and software, so others may also recreate and reappropriate and build on top of my work in the open source. One function of this project could also be to reveal web mapping’s relationship to computation by placing it within a history of cartographic science and technique. </p>

    <h2>Municipal Archives</h2>
    <p>How do municipalities archive the information they produce and how do their archival methods foreclose or inform on future spatial practices that may be based on them? What if municipal archives were structured around the critical approaches to the core themes of governance, like debt, assessment, taxation, etc. What kinds of systems would need to be developed to facilitate civic tech that had historical sensitivity and sensibility? What kinds of information could be integrated in relation to those themes that currently exist outside the archival purview of the state? This project would review current archival practices across a few municipal sites, and attempt to build systems that demonstrate meaningful alternatives, counterpoints, or additions to those practices. Computation would assist in redeveloping the means of curating, collecting, categorizing and interfacing with archival collections. </p>
