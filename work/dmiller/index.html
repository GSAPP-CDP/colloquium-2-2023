        <p> What is location intelligence and which ways of knowing location, space, and place does it foreground?</p>
        <p>What’s at stake with the proliferation of location intelligence platforms and what is the fate of place?</p>
        <p>How can I intervene in the trajectory of these systems, and counter them with creative, critical, and humanistic approaches to geography, at scale? </p>

        <p>And what role does representation play in fashioning the digital geographies that web maps can understand, and in turn our understanding and experience of physical space and place?</p>

        <p>I will work through the tools of mapping , GIS, and spatial data science to explore these questions, while building, assembling, and synthesizing data. This is currently taking shape as a massive corpus of text, that I know is spatial in some way. I am learning that most text is spatial. It has been an open ended search for texts that I find relevant, compelling, and influential. I have currently assembled text from a few widely used corpora, and datasets from open street map and overture map foundation (for locations and places of interest). It’s important for this project to challenge defaults in data collection, so I’m looking to a number of other possible sources for text data (oral histories, court documents, archives, open street map change log discussion forums) and place data (municipal datasets, etc). There will be a lot of data available to me, the challenge becomes structuring it, and understanding how to situate any analysis of it in context.</p>
        <p>I will need to develop new methods for working with these data, in addition to augmenting existing methods, this includes developing a text model for identifying places in text that goes beyond conventional geoparsing models in its ability to tag spatial and place-ful text as such.</p>
        <p>I am designing representations of these data outputs, and the locations/spaces/places they document, and then hope to facilitate interactions with and between them. </p>

        <p>Others have approached these same topics and tensions. From journalistic output on the implications of location intelligence tech on privacy, urban planning and design, and real estate; to artistic explorations of place making, digital geographies, the affective and experiential nature of place and representations of it; to critical and participatory mapping projects which seek to situate information, narratives, experiences spatially.</p>

        <p>Digital Humanities scholars have theorized that new, critical approaches to massive text corpora will channel the potential of doing distributed, collective history, comparative literature, geography, and so on. </p>
        <p>But the middle ground has been underdeveloped because its very challenging — expensive, hard to imagine and creatively taxing, requiring the development of tools and new modes of representation to convey the knowledge that might be developed there. </p>
        <p>Critical cartographers have made countless, compelling, mapping projects which invite participation from individuals to share what they know or have experienced in a location. The act of mapping that associated text or spatial knowledge can be seen as radical, because we were not used to seeing certain reflections or representations of ourselves, in less mediated or aggregated formats, on maps. We’re not used to channeling the agency of maps and the data and ways of knowing that underly them given their histories.</p>
        <p>But if we use prevalent mapping platforms and the products of location intelligence we are often unwitting and sometimes non-consenting participants in the largest and most extractive participatory mapping project of this era (of digital mapping). We are all reflected in, and in turn shaped, by location intelligence systems. Could the critical cartographic and humanistic ethos and its political potential be scaled to match these systems? </p>
        <p>What is challenging is addressing the experiential nature of place at scale without subjecting it to the objectification, commodification, and flattening that location intelligence platforms do. I want to grapple with this, and learn by struggling to scale up it up, by designing computational solutions to assist alongside. I think this will lead me in some surprising directions with what I design and what the final output will be, beyond just building the massive corpus and methods needed to assemble, structure, and analyze it.</p>
        <p>What are some questions about landscape, space, and place, that could be answered differently? 

            What would maps look like if they were designed to convey the kinds of information I’m hoping to generate?</p>
