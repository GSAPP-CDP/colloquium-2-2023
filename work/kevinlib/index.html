            <h2>1.	A metaproject on “Human-X-interaction”</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on ontological discourse around human-computer-interaction (HCI), nascent variations of it, such as human-building-interaction (HBI) and explores what lies beyond HCI when we begin to merge and relate humans, computers, spaces, environments, ecologies, and materials to one another. This project will introduce a new philosophy or framework for thinking about human-X-interaction through applications or case studies. These examples will illustrate extensions of HCI past its current two-dimensional paradigm (human-computer) to include other natural and artificial systems. The implications of the proposed perspective will serve as commentary around what it means to be human, to design, and how it can play a role in imagining possible futures.</p>

            <h2>2.	Constructions and Demolitions</h2>
            <p>The building sector consumes a vast amount of natural resources. In fact, construction is the primary source of waste produced in the European Union. Too often though, this consumption is hidden from us behind site fences, wooden panels, and red tape. This project emphasizes the built environment as an active, longitudinal process. Interactive visualizations compiled of satellite imagery and Google Street View data will show the cellular automata created by constructions and demolitions. This project will explore if there is emergent behavior from this zoomed out scale, either by self-evident patterns or learned algorithms, and what (if any) insights can be drawn from this behavior.</p>

            <h2>3. Digital Strata</h2>
            <p>
                Re>crete> (by Charles Goldman) is a type of custom-made concrete that creatively reuses day-to-day waste (e.g. shredded newspaper, junk-mail, ground-up Styrofoam, discarded electronic wires, credit cards, CDs, lint, etc.) as aggregate. Digital Strata is an installation that spans physical and virtual space. A sculpture reinforces the strength and durability of the material and invites the audience to inspect it with immediacy. Meanwhile, digital immersive media provides the audience with context, metadata on the junk (What is it? Where did it come from? Who did it belong to?), crafting a retelling of our material attachment in society and playing with our sense of memory and time. At once, the once-forgotten scrap serves as both building material and archaelogical evidence, geological and digital stratification.
