                <p><b>Let’s set the stage: </b></p>
                <p>
                    In my last two years of high school, I took an advanced art class and 
                    chose Nigerian musical instruments as the subject of my work. With over 200 languages and 
                    their associated cultures in Nigeria, this is a very broad field. I thought that would give 
                    me ample opportunities to observe traditional instruments up close and in use. In post-colonial 
                    Nigeria, where many traditions were dying out, I struggled to find most instruments. I had to rely 
                    on online images of instruments held by Western museums that I couldn’t afford to visit.
                </p>
                <P>
                    <b><i></i>Benin (Edo in the indigenous language) is not a static fragment of Nigerian history.</i></b> The descendants of the 
                    creators, owners, and users of the cultural artifacts I am interested in are still members of the Kingdom of Benin. 
                </P>
                <p>
                        <b><i>Benin Bronzes:</i></b> a term used to describe thousands of items stolen from the palace of the 
                        Oba (<i>king</i>) of Benin in February 1897 during the British Punitive (<i>Colonial</i>) Expedition to (<i>Military Campaign on</i>) Benin. They are the spoils of war.

                        <p>2023</p>
                        <p>
                            Before he handed over the highest political seat, former President Buhari passed ownership of all Benin Bronzes that will be returned to 
                            Nigeria from the Federal Government to the Oba (King) of Benin. This sent shockwaves through the museums 
                            that previously pledged to return the cultural artifacts, stalling the most successful attempt at returning 
                            the largest amount of these artifacts to date. It is important to note that the cultural artifacts referred 
                            to as the Benin Bronzes were mainly taken from the king’s palace when the British colonial forces ransacked 
                            the capital. Technically, they <i>were</i> stolen from the current king’s ancestors and <i>are</i> the property 
                            of the Royal Court and its artisans.

                        The Edo Museum of West African Art is announced as the new home for all the returned Edo cultural artifacts. The 
                        winning design by David Adjaye is still yet to be built. It operates online as though it is up and running already. 
                        Limited information is available about the progress of the institution.

                        <p>
                            The British Punitive [<i>Colonial</i>] Expedition to [<i>Military Campaign on</i>] Benin, February 1897 resulted 
                            in the dispersal of cultural artifacts taken from the Oba's palace grounds. It was the climax of a war between the 
                            British colonial forces and the Kingdom of Benin, or Edo as they call themselves. All but a handful of the cultural artifacts 
                            stolen from the Kingdom of Benin were taken during this time.

                            The commissioning of bronze heads and figures in honor or a member of the royal family began in the 16th century, when one of the Obas 
                            commisioned the artisan guilds to make an image of one of the queen.

                            The Kingodm of Benin, which we can also refer to as the Edo Kingdom and the Benin Empire, was birthed from the Igodomigodo kingdom, which was also founded by 
                            the Edo peope. Arriọba ẹdo, as it is called in the indigenous Bini language, was "one of the oldest and most developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa" before 
                            the greed of the British Imperial state tried to wipe it from existence in 1897 (Strayer, 2013, Ways of the World).
