        <h1>Equitable Identification of Healthcare Sites & Typologies</h1>
        <h3>Inequalities in Access to Health Services in America</h3>
        <p>
          Largely there are geographic and economic factors that cause
          inequalities in access to health services throughout the United
          states. First, residents in rural areas often experience barriers to
          health services due to travel distances and medical workforce
          shortages. As of September 2022, 65.6% of Primary Care Health
          Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. Second,
          lower-income Americans are less likely to have health insurance
          coverage and therefore lose the chance to prevent serious diseases.
          The rate of avoidable hospital conditions(AHC), hospitalization
          avoidable through timely and quality primary and preventive care, is
          particularly high with lower-income minorities.
          <u
            >So how do I avoid these systematic inequalities in creating
            hospital sites selection tools?</u

        <h3>
          Inequalities in the current demand estimate model for health services
        </h3>
        <p>
          The current model to estimate demand for health services has an
          inequality issue. HRSA (Health Resources & Services Administration)
          runs The Health Workforce Simulation Model(HWSM) to estimate the
          current and the future demand for health care. Projections of demand
          from HWSM inform policies to provide adequate supply of health care
          workers at the national, state, and local levels. The problem is that
          the current estimate model heavily relies on medical insurance data
          and leaves out the uninsured and vulnerable population. As you can see
          from the image below, only 49% of the population is under
          employer-based insurance and nearly 40% of the population is either
          enrolled in medicaid/medicare or uninsured.
          <u></u>
            My hypothesis is that this 40% vulnerable population(red) is getting
            less geographic access to healthcare services than the
            employer-based and direct-purchase insured population(blue).</u

        <h3>New Audiences in Reduced Barrier Scenario</h3>
        <p>
          With recent initiatives such as Healthy People 2030 by the US
          government, national and state goals are to remove barriers that
          contribute to inequities in use of health services. This will greatly
          affect medical demand estimates from the Medical Expenditure Panel
          Survey(MEPS) data.
          <u
            >The equitable hospital site identification research will include
            the vulnerables such as uninsured patients and medicaid recipients
            based on the new demand from reduced barrier scenario.</u

        <h3>Conventional Datasets for healthcare business</h3>
        <p>
          Healthcare business owners, developers, and professionals first consider 
          feasibility, profitability, and operational efficiency when selecting a 
          site for healthcare. Most of the existing hospitals have been located after 
          thorough consideration of the categories below. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Affordability:</b> real estate costs can vary greatly depending on location including costs to develop particular sites based on existing infrastructure. Opportunities to repurpose existing infrastructure to accommodate new healthcare facilities can make the project affordable. 
          </li>
          <br />
          <li><b>Demographics & Population Density:</b> factors such as population’s age, income, insurance coverage, overall health status, and population density largely affect profitability.</li>
          <br />
          <li><b>Zoning & land use:</b> ensure that the zoning and land use laws allow healthcare business in the proposed location.</li>
          <br />
          <li><b>Accessibility:</b> convenient access to healthcare facilities is crucial, whether through personal transportation, or public transit.</li>

        <h3>Datasets for the Vulnerable Population (equitable healthcare)</h3>
        <p>
          Based on the combined datasets below, I will try to answer my hypothesis that vulnerable people in the US are left out in the current healthcare systems. Then, I will pinpoint those areas where vulnerable populations have limited geographic access to healthcare services. Those places will be used for ideal locations for the future hospitals to reduce the current inequalities in access to healthcare services.

        <h3>How Computational Relationships Manifest</h3>
        <p>
          In my capstone project, the digital agency will compute input data such as existing hospital locations, SVI, public transportations, and travel time to filter and narrow down sites for equitable future healthcare. The digital tool will function like a survey, equipped with spatial data and maps, to collect site options at scale from multiple stakeholders. Then it will process and analyze collected site options from the survey and give insights on what criteria each stakeholder values the most. The digital agency is not only for down selecting optimal sites for individuals but also for managing and mediating competing priorities to draw an optimal site from consensus.

        <h3>Precedent Works</h3>
        <p>
          <u>1. The Department of Geography at Michigan State University</u> has done
          research on the hospital site selection process for the state of
          Michigan. As many medical studies suggest that the 30 minutes
          threshold is critical for the survival of patients, the research
          concentrated on identifying populations with long drive times to
          existing community hospitals. Areas falling outside of the 30 minutes
          threshold are identified as limited access areas, which now inform
          state policy in evaluation of new local hospital proposals. The
          research points out geographic inequality in access to health
          services, but it does not mention low-income groups without health
          insurance and racial or ethnic minorities.

          <u>2. Scout from KPF UI</u> empowers clients or community members to engage in design decision making processes. stakeholders including community members are able to contribute their voice to the design phase with Scout. I want to know how Scout helps a design team to collect, analyze, and present design ideas from many stakeholders. And what process a design team has to go through, equipped with Scout, to narrow down multiple design options and distill one collective design? What is the role of the digital agency(Scout) in mediating conflicting priorities from multiple stakeholders?
