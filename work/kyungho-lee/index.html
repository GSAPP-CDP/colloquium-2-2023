        <h1>I. Equitable Hospital Sites Identification Methodology</h1>
        <h3>Inequalities in Access to Health Services in America</h3>
        <p>
          Largely there are geographic and economic factors that cause
          inequalities in access to health services throughout the United
          states. First, residents in rural areas often experience barriers to
          health services due to travel distances and medical workforce
          shortages. As of September 2022, 65.6% of Primary Care Health
          Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. Second,
          lower-income Americans are less likely to have health insurance
          coverage and therefore lose the chance to prevent serious diseases.
          The rate of avoidable hospital conditions(AHC), hospitalization
          avoidable through timely and quality primary and preventive care, is
          particularly high with lower-income minorities.
          <u
            >So how do I avoid these systematic inequalities in creating
            hospital sites selection tools?</u
          >

        <h3>
          Inequalities in the current demand estimate model for health services
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/data-research/projecting-health-workforce-supply-demand/technical-documentation/modeling-demand-health-care"
            >HRSA</a
          >(Health Resources & Services Administration) runs The Health
          Workforce Simulation Model(HWSM) to estimate the current and the
          future demand for health care. Projections of demand from HWSM inform
          policies to provide adequate supply of health care workers at the
          national, state, and local levels. The problem is that the current
          estimate model heavily relies on medical insurance data and leaves out
          the uninsured population. Those people with higher-income are more
          likely to have regular physical examinations with medical insurance
          and therefore documented in the database as medical demand. If the
          hospital site selection process depends on such databases, then the
          system will make the current medical inequality worse.
          <u
            >Are there alternative ways leveraging computational methods to
            equitably estimate population in medical needs which include
            uninsured and left out minorities in the current biased model?</u
          >

        <h3>Hospital Sites Selection Precedents</h3>
        <p>
          The Department of Geography at Michigan State University has done
          research on the hospital site selection process for the state of
          Michigan. As many medical studies suggest that the 30 minutes
          threshold is critical for the survival of patients, the research
          concentrated on identifying populations with long drive times to
          existing community hospitals. Areas falling outside of the 30 minutes
          threshold are identified as limited access areas, which now inform
          state policy in evaluation of new local hospital proposals. The
          research points out geographic inequality in access to health
          services, but it does not mention low-income groups without health
          insurance and racial or ethnic minorities.

        <h3>New Audiences in Reduced Barrier Scenario</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Policy makers pursuing equity in health services</li>
          <li>Uninsured patients</li>
          <li>Medicaid recipients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With recent initiatives such as Healthy People 2030 by the US
          government, national and state goals are to remove barriers that
          contribute to inequities in use of health services. This will greatly
          affect medical demand estimates from the Medical Expenditure Panel
          Survey(MEPS) data.
          <u
            >The equitable hospital site identification research will include
            the vulnerables such as uninsured patients and medicaid recipients
            based on the new demand from reduced barrier scenario.</u

          <li>
            <b>Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)</b> uses 16 U.S. census
            variables(age, race, employment, education, etc) to help local
            officials identify communities that may need support before, during,
            or after disasters.

          <li>
            <b>Medicaid Enrollment</b> provides free health insurance for
            low-income adults and children. The enrollment eligibility depends
            on income, disability, and employment status.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Avoidable Hospital Conditions (AHC)</b> is inpatient stays that
            evidence suggests may be avoidable through timely and quality
            primary and preventive care. The rate of hospital discharges for AHC
            is used to represent inequality in some research.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Above datasets can be used to pinpoint the most vulnerable site for
          future hospital proposals with equity. Besides these data, I plan to
          further research on the new equitable medical demand estimate
          methodology from HRSA (Health Resources & Services Administration).

        <h3>
          GIS mapping with AI to guide citizens to make data-driven decision for
          equity
        </h3>
        <p>
          Since the last decade, there have been many participatory urban
          planning initiatives such as NYC’s participatory budgeting(PB) and
          Barcelona’s PB on Decidim, Barcelona’s digital platform for democratic
          citizen participation in municipality budgeting. These efforts have
          made public budgeting decisions to be aligned with residents’
          knowledge of local conditions and shifted public spending priorities
          towards more equitable public investments in general. On the other
          hand, a case study of Chicago wards, in the first three years after
          adopting PB, showed that higher income neighborhoods had benefited
          disproportionally from PB. In some of Chicago wards, economically
          advantaged residents participated more actively in PB and decided to
          spend public spending more on higher income neighborhoods.

            >How do I leverage AI and GIS mapping to guide them to make
            data-driven decisions for social equity rather than making decisions
            for their economic interests?</b

        <h3>
          Leveraging AI to guide residents to make equitable decision based on
          data prior to participation
        </h3>
        <p>
          The city of Tacoma’s Office of Human Rights in Washington State worked
          with Ohio State University to develop an opportunity index to
          highlight social disparities and integrated the index as a tool in
          making city council decisions and city budget proposals.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/opportunity_index.JPG" />
        <p>
          The use of opportunity index has affected the city council’s decision
          on spending the public budget in a more equitable way. For example, in
          2019 Public Works had a $200k budget to add 200 new streetlights for
          public safety. After taking into account the opportunity index along
          with a safety factor, the Public Works’ decision on installation
          locations slightly changed to support lower-income neighborhoods.
