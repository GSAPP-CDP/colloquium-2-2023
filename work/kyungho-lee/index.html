        <h1>I. Equitable Hospital Sites Identification Methodology</h1>
        <h3>Inequalities in Access to Health Services in America</h3>
        <p>
          Largely there are geographic and economic factors that cause
          inequalities in access to health services throughout the United
          states. First, residents in rural areas often experience barriers to
          health services due to travel distances and medical workforce
          shortages. As of September 2022, 65.6% of Primary Care Health
          Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. Second,
          lower-income Americans are less likely to have health insurance
          coverage and therefore lose the chance to prevent serious diseases.
          The rate of avoidable hospital conditions(AHC), hospitalization
          avoidable through timely and quality primary and preventive care, is
          particularly high with lower-income minorities.
          <u
            >So how do I avoid these systematic inequalities in creating
            hospital sites selection tools?</u
          >

        <h3>
          Inequalities in the current demand estimate model for health services
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/data-research/projecting-health-workforce-supply-demand/technical-documentation/modeling-demand-health-care"
            >HRSA</a
          >(Health Resources & Services Administration) runs The Health
          Workforce Simulation Model(HWSM) to estimate the current and the
          future demand for health care. Projections of demand from HWSM inform
          policies to provide adequate supply of health care workers at the
          national, state, and local levels. The problem is that the current
          estimate model heavily relies on medical insurance data and leaves out
          the uninsured population. Those people with higher-income are more
          likely to have regular physical examinations with medical insurance
          and therefore documented in the database as medical demand. If the
          hospital site selection process depends on such databases, then the
          system will make the current medical inequality worse.
          <u
            >Are there alternative ways leveraging computational methods to
            equitably estimate population in medical needs which include
            uninsured and left out minorities in the current biased model?</u

        <h3>Hospital Sites Selection Precedents</h3>
        <p>
          The Department of Geography at Michigan State University has done
          research on the hospital site selection process for the state of
          Michigan. As many medical studies suggest that the 30 minutes
          threshold is critical for the survival of patients, the research
          concentrated on identifying populations with long drive times to
          existing community hospitals. Areas falling outside of the 30 minutes
          threshold are identified as limited access areas, which now inform
          state policy in evaluation of new local hospital proposals. The
          research points out geographic inequality in access to health
          services, but it does not mention low-income groups without health
          insurance and racial or ethnic minorities.

        <h3>New Audiences in Reduced Barrier Scenario</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Policy makers pursuing equity in health services</li>
          <li>Uninsured patients</li>
          <li>Medicaid recipients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With recent initiatives such as Healthy People 2030 by the US
          government, national and state goals are to remove barriers that
          contribute to inequities in use of health services. This will greatly
          affect medical demand estimates from the Medical Expenditure Panel
          Survey(MEPS) data.
          <u
            >The equitable hospital site identification research will include
            the vulnerables such as uninsured patients and medicaid recipients
            based on the new demand from reduced barrier scenario.</u

        <h3>Datasets to address current medical inequalities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            current distribution of hospitals in the US
            <img src="./images/distribution of hospitals.JPG" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)</b> uses 16 U.S. census
            variables(age, race, employment, education, etc) to help local
            officials identify communities that may need support before, during,
            or after disasters.
            <img src="./images/svi_interactive_map.jpg" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL)</b> represents
            community-specific health vulnerability in the United States by
            measuring rates of premature death
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Medicaid Enrollment</b> provides free health insurance for
            low-income adults and children. The enrollment eligibility depends
            on income, disability, and employment status.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Avoidable Hospital Conditions (AHC)</b> is inpatient stays that
            evidence suggests may be avoidable through timely and quality
            primary and preventive care. The rate of hospital discharges for AHC
            is used to represent inequality in some research.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Above datasets can be used to pinpoint the most vulnerable site for
          future hospital proposals with equity. Besides these data, I plan to
          further research on the new equitable medical demand estimate
          methodology from HRSA (Health Resources & Services Administration).
