    <h1>Assignment 1: Capstone Project Ideas</h1>
    
    <h2>My overall ideas all fit under the theme of a smart house. My interests in the smart home really center around leveraging technology for the disability community and privacy and security of smart home IOT devices. This led me to came up with the following 3 ideas for my capstone: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Having a disability is the only marginalized group that almost everyone will be a part of in their lifetime. It doesn’t really make sense to me that we don’t innovate for those with disabilities more often given that we will almost all be impacted by accessibility (or lack of) efforts in our life. I think that taking care of my grandparents (who have problems with mobility and memory) has led me to be really interested in thinking about aging and disability and usability of technology for aging users. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I’m also really interested in privacy, especially in regards to tech in the home: including privacy and security challenges for kids using video games and remote learning on school post COVID-19 pandemic (and intentionally designing for children privacy and security), elderly people’s use of voice-activated technology, children’s privacy literacy with respect to smart home technology.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I’m also interested in how long and short-distance families' relationships are impacted by the use of smart home IoT devices.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Following Desk Crits, I amended my list to the following, keeping with the umbrella theme of smart homes:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Innovative haptic interaction design space / furniture</p>
            <p>This started with an interest in wearables for haptic embodied experiences, shape changing UIs, and dynamic and adaptive furniture. Changes shape and detects and gives force. Real time haptic feedback in response. Uses: In the home integrating shape display into everyday lives like furniture, or physical shapes to digital data so they can manipulate it with their hands. This comes from my interest in wearables like actuated clothing for embodied haptic experiences like to give physical feedback beyond a video game controller for example. Goal is to engage the body in ways beyond current ways. => but take this further into the home environment. Haptic interaction design space and furniture leverages computation, using sensors, actuators, responsive materials for tactile feedback and to adapt to user preferences, thinking beyond smart furniture can adjust its shape and firmness based on the user’s posture and more in the direction of shape and location to further integrate with the user’s day to day. Haptic feedback can engage senses in new ways. Fusing haptics, computation, and the home for an interactive, personalized, and immersive user interaction with our physical surroundings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Builds on Sara Hendren’s Engineering at home project: I am inspired by her archive of low-tech prosthetics and curious how to expand on this idea of leveraging the tech that those with disabilities rig for themselves to integrate into home environments in a more high tech way.</p>
            
<p>I like her idea of an archive of what is done by those with disabilities already, I really like the concept of engineering at home. Computational integration makes sense for me as a technologist, but I think this source of custom made assistive devices is a really special idea to connect with smart home ecosystems. I think about all the random things we’ve rigged in my grandparents house and the potential of incorporating sensors and IoT technology to enhance their independence.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Smart home IoT devices and privacy!</p>
            <p>This idea engages with computation in so many ways because IoT devices collect and process a ton of data which causes the privacy concerns I'm talking abut. They gather all sorts of data about user's habits and preferences, use encryption and authentication to secure, and I have a lot of questions about consent in relation to that a lot of users don't know what is going on behind the scene. I think mental models is an interesting thing to compare here and children and elderly people are especially vulnerable. I think transparency and accountability in how data is handled as well as tools to educate users about privacy implications here is also interesting. </p>

        <li>
            <p>Further reading ie tech <=> radically incorporating those with disabilities into society instead of pushing them to the fringes</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dementia Villages (Amsterdam)</li>
                <li>"Blindenstadt," a city for blind (Germany)</li>
            </ul>
