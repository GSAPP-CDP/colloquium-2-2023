        <p>the map as instrument is not a spatial chopping block
        <br><br>I hope to try and subvert the ingrained behavior of the map as a tool for creating and perpetuating arbitrary divisions in space

          <br><br>For instance, analog radio propagation signal contours don’t represent a harsh dropoff of signal, but rather the range without signal interference. 
          I’m trying to think about sound, signal values, and space in terms of interfering wave patterns.
          
          <br><br>Compared to the continuity of signal waves, Digital signal receivers have a cardinality: the device is linked to one and only one signal. 
          
          <br><br>Treating the map user as a signal receiver, my map will have a method of sonifying this switching mechanism which would be difficult to understand visually. 
          </p>

         <br><br>some things to think about:
          <ul>a place’s audio fingerprint vs arbitrary lines</ul>
          <ul>interfering signals vs. binary dropoffs
          aka continuous gradients </ul>
          <uL>+ rhythmic oscillations vs discrete edges</uL>
