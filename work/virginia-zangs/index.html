        <h2>Digital Twinning of Tuvalu: A Confluence of Geology, Migration, and Virtual Preservation</h2>

    <div class="text-field">
        <p>This fall I am taking part in the Data Mourning Clinic, led by Marina Otero Verzier with Farah Alkhoury, which analyzes the case of Tuvalu and its plans to become the first fully virtual nation by transferring itself to the metaverse.</p>
        <p> Clinic Brief:
            "The Pacific island-nation of Tuvalu, a coral atoll comprised of islands inhabited by 12,000 people is disappearing under the sea. With an alarming rate of sea-level rise at 3.9 mm per year (twice the global average) due to global warming, the nation is confronting the grim reality of its imminent submergence.
            At the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, during the COP27 climate summit, Tuvalu's Minister, Simon Kofe, addressed the assembled delegates, emphasizing the need to prepare for his country's survival: "Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious assets of our people and to keep them safe from harm, no matter what happens in the physical world, we will move them to the cloud*," he asserted.
            Faced with the impending loss of their tangible homeland, the people of Tuvalu find solace in the intangible realm, seeking refuge within the digital sphere. 
            As we witness the unraveling of worlds, the possibility of Tuvalu's digital twin opens questions on how to address the fragility of environments and communities, their care, custodianship, preservation and eventual loss in the face of the climate catastrophe."
        </p>
        <p>Tuvalu, with its low-lying coral atolls sculpted by the ocean, presents a relevant case study. As the nation contemplates a revolutionary move to transfer its essence into the metaverse, it beckons a profound exploration. My research aims to delve into the geology, morphology, and the diverse life - both human and non-human - of Tuvalu, envisioning its digital twin. This twin won't merely be a digital replica but a dynamic entity encapsulating Tuvalu's past, present, and potential future.
        Employing critical mapping, data analysis, and generative design, this research will be critical of the colonial histories and the precedents of data and knowledge structures and infrastructures. The transformation from physical to digital offers an opportunity to both preserve and critically evaluate the exploitative nature of data preservation. Understanding Tuvalu's migration patterns, histories and transformations (human and non-human) can provide invaluable insights to inform the future and a potential digital twin of Tuvalu.
        </p>
        <p>The proposal to create a digital twin of Tuvalu is not just a challenging technological endeavor but an exercise in storytelling and data analysis. The digital representation of Tuvalu serves as a narrative medium, translating complex geological, environmental, and anthropological data into a format that is both accessible and engaging for a wider audience.</p>
        <p>+ The process of digitization brings forth critical questions about data.
            + Data storage, while essential for preserving Tuvalu's legacy, has its own environmental and ethical implications. Modern data centers, where information is stored and processed, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. The infrastructure supporting these centers relies heavily on material extraction, often from regions already vulnerable to climate change and socio-economic challenges. This extractive nature extends beyond just materials; it encompasses data itself, raising questions about who records, provides, and ultimately owns this data.
            The ownership and control of data storage infrastructures and networks are often concentrated in the hands of a few global corporations. This centralization poses risks related to data sovereignty, especially for nations like Tuvalu. Who gets to tell Tuvalu's story in the digital realm? Who ensures that the data isn't exploited, misrepresented, or misinterpreted?
            By integrating critical mapping, data analysis, and generative design, this research will not only envision Tuvalu's digital counterpart but will also critically assess the implications of data storage and ownership. The goal is to create a digital legacy for Tuvalu that is both environmentally conscious and ethically sound. How to ensure that the nation's narrative remains authentic and self-represented?

    <h2>II</h2>
    <h2>Psyche of Climate Change & Migration</h2>
    <div class="text-field">
        <p>I would like to explore interactive mapping tools, to visualize the spread of misinformation, in digital and physical space. By understanding and countering these spaces, corridors and networks of information and narratives, I would like to gain insights in how more informed and empathetic information can be distributed to climate-induced migration.</p>
        <p>This research must critically examine the entities controlling data recording and distribution, such as private satellite companies, data center locations, and private telecommunication services like Starlink, to understand their roles, underlying incentives, and potential biases in shaping the narrative on climate change, climate mitigation, migration and conflict zones.</p>
        <p>Social Networks - Analyze the structure and dynamics of social networks to identify key influencers spreading misinformation. How can machine learning be used to predict how misinformation might spread across networks and which regions are most susceptible? How does it correlate to conflict zones,
        Geolocation and Mapping - Integrate geolocation data to visualize the spread of misinformation on maps - Identify regions where misinformation is prevalent and correlate with potential conflict zones, zones impacted by climate change and migration
        (Visualization, Simulation, Mapping, Geolocation and Predictive Analysis, Social Network Analysis, Health Misinformation, Cultural and Social Cohesion, Policy Implications)</p>
        <p>How does cognitive science influence public perceptions and reactions to misinformation regarding climate change and migration, and what are the implications for policy and societal responses?</p>
