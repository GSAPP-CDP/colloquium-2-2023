                <p>In the quest for a sustainable future in the 21st century, we face multifaceted challenges: climate change, environmental degradation, economic disparity, global health crises, and the impacts of technological advancements like artificial intelligence. Political instability, shifting population dynamics, migration, resource scarcity, and the need for sustainable agriculture further intensify these challenges, calling for global cooperation and innovative, sustainable development strategies.</p>
                <p>Global cooperation and collaboration can be understood as a new single consciousness - in our globally connected and networked world, constructed by technological information systems and infrastructures - the internet - Holly Jean Buck argues networks and infrastructures do not only 'play a role in global events like COVID-19 or climate change, but shape them.' This prompts critical questions about power dynamics, data, knowledge, and digital sovereignty in this era of a primarily commodified, market-driven digital world. How can we reimagine these structures to ensure a viable future for our society and planet? </p>

                <p>From the first media revolution in the 15th century, to models of cybernetics to concepts of ecosystems, to the era of post-truth and deep fakes, our societies and perception of possibility of action and interference have been shaped by media technological revolutions and their ontological frameworks. We constructed a language of humans being in Dominion of the world, in control of manageable objects, such as Technology or Nature. Climate Change and AI - Large Language Models have recently challenged this perception and are pressing us to reconsider our entanglement and relationality with the world.</p>
                <p>I am interest in how knowledge, specifically around climate action, is produced, and how debates are disputed across disciplines.

            <p>My research takes a multifaceted approach, by critically examining Tuvalu's past, present, and potential futures. Specifically, I am focused on the "undesirable" scenario that Tuvalu is treading as it is planning to become a digital nation or digital twin. I am exploring the technological, political, ethical, and environmental implications of this transition, referred to as a "migration" of a state into "digital exile."

                as Tuvalu's Minister for Justice, Communication & Foreign Affairs, Simon Kofe says: ...the metaverse is also an important part of that because the metaverse is a platform that we feel would best communicate our culture to future generations and to anyone who wants to learn more about Tuvalu. We feel that the metaverse provides an immersive experience for people, and building a virtual copy of Tuvalu not only preserves our culture, it improves accessibility. It allows us to also upload data, make projections on the impacts of climate change.</p>

            <p>Web 2.0 - Scientific Database Analysis</p>
            <p>The idea of a -digital twin- was born by -NASA in the 1960s as a -living model- of the Apollo mission. In response to Apollo 13s oxygen tank explosion and subsequent damage to the main engine, NASA employed multiple simulators to evaluate the failure and extended a physical model of the vehicle to include digital components.- NASA used this twin to simulate potential past and future scenarios, to save their astronauts from suffocating in space. 

                Virtual twins have become relevant across research, industries and planning practices - a digital twin is a virtual counterpart or simulation of an actual real physical object, asset, or environment, used for real-time monitoring, simulation of possible scenarios, analysis, optimisation and risk management across different time-scales. 
                
                Today, companies like NVIDIA are building digital twins - and worlds - the Omniverse is a computing platform that enables collaborative 3D content creation and simulation across industries, allowing users to create, share, and interact with 3D worlds within virtual environments.</p>

These examples can provide inspiring frameworks for a potential new concept of a digital future. They develop technological, financial and governance tools, narratives and games, are including indigenous practices, knowledge, and interspecies discourse across physical, virtual, and cyberspace; building new worlds, decentralised networks of care, collaborative nations and extitutions, by leveraging the potential of technology, blockchain and artificial intelligence. </p>
