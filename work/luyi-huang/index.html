    <p>Currently, most of the land in US is Suburban Context. However, compared to people living in a carless urban context, the residents living in the suburban context produce 4 times more carbon footprint every year. One of reasons is because the more centralized city form allows people to consume less energy consumption on daily transportation.

    <p> 3.	Robotic housing unit will bring in the idea of Half Size Home (units/floor plan/ interior)</p>
