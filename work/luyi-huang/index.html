    <h2>Design Proposal</h2>
    <p>This is a proposal about redefining architectural and urban systems to achieve low carbon emissions.
    Currently, most of the land in US is Suburban Context. However, compared to people living in a carless urban context, the residents living in the suburban context produce 4 times more carbon footprint every year. One of reasons is because the more centralized city form allows people to consume less energy consumption on daily transportation.
    There are three scales/ideas/directions for this project
    1.	Centralize the city to only use Half Land Occupation (urban)
    2.	Vertical block which will create a new urban community and social context (building
    3.	Robotic housing unit will bring in the idea of Half Size Home (units/floor plan/ interior)
    The global warming comes much faster than everybody thought. It is urgent, it does not have time to wait.</p>
